1. Set up the working directory and load the packages

```
#WD
setwd("~/") #erases previously set WDs
setwd("DS - Personal repo - Zoja/Data Science Tutorial") #sets a new one
getwd() #check that it's worked

#Libraries
library(ggmap)
library(tidyverse)
```

2. Set up the google maps conenction
- Find your API key 
      - go to Google Maps Platform -> Credentials
      - Select "Create project" and name it something appropriate; ignore the organisation
      - Press 'Create'
      - Copy the API key it provides you (AIzaSyDnersipSvcXuK4tCDbr8NOpa-qsrYf9pc)
      
- Add it into RStudio:
```
#Set up the google maps connection
get_googlemap(center = "Edinburgh", zoom = 15) %>% ggmap()
ggmap::register_google(key = "AIzaSyDnersipSvcXuK4tCDbr8NOpa-qsrYf9pc", 
                       write = TRUE) #register your own Google API Key here
```
I got Edinburgh here because that is what I am plotting; adjust the zoom as necessary


3. Select the data you want to use:
```
coords <- read.csv("traits_analysis.csv") %>% 
          select("long", "lat", "code", "type", "latin_name") %>%  #select the longitude, latitude, invasion type and species code
          mutate(type = recode(type, "Alien" = "Alien species",
                         "Invasive" = "Invasive species", 
                         "Naturalised" = "Naturalised species", 
                         "Native" = "Native species")) #recode the invasion type names
```

4. Plot onto Google maps:
