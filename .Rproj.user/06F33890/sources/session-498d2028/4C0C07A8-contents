# Tutorial dataset metadata

The data used in this tutorial with come from two of my projects: a field course and my dissertation. The leaves dataset is my dissertation dataset (I collected a variety of leaf trait data to compare the differences between naturalised, native, and invasive tree species in Scotland). The bugs dataset is from the 4th year field course I attended this summer during which we collected insect diversity data from pitfall traps along different transects across forest edges. Both datasets contain a wide array of data, but for the purpose of this tutorial, we are mostly interested in the location data (the longitude and latitude columns) and the descriptors (e.g. the tree species or the transect ID). Below you can find a more detailed description of each project.

### Dissertation dataset:

The partial dissertation dataset (leaves) this tutorial uses is the data I've collected so far (since August 1st, 2023) for my dissertation, which aims to define the differences in leaf traits between native, naturalised, and invasive tree and shrub species in Scotland. The premise of the study is to evaluate these leaf trait differences (if they exist) within the Scottish tree/shrub species context, similar to the study done by Divíšek _et al._ (2018) which found that invasive species in Central Europe differ significantly in their traits from native species.

### Field course dataset:
The dataset from the field course (bugs) that is used in this tutorial is the data we collected between September 2nd and 7th, 2023 during the 4th year EES field course. The aim was to determine whether there are differences in plant and invertebrate diversity across forest edges (between a coniferous timber plantation and a recently felled timber plantation area).
