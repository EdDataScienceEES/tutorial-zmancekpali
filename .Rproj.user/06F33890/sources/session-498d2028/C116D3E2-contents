**Coding etiquette for this repository:**
The following rules should be upheld at all times when coding or working within this repository.
1. Informative comments are included throughout the code, using the hashtag (#) symbol. There are no spaces before the hashtags.
2. The code is spaced out adequately to make it easier to read.
3. The work is broken down into sections (by adding ---- at the end of each section title if necessary).
4. All objects are given informative names (using snake case if necessary).
5. Keep your code to under 100 characters in length per line (comments can extend past that if necessary; if a comment extends to the following line, it is not capitalised - to ensure consistency and a logical way of following the comments).
6. The script begins with setting the working directory, importing the libraries, and then the data. The consequent sections follow the logic of the assignment as necessary.
